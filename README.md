# Gold Coin Problem (Dynamic Programming)
## 2801ICT – COMPUTING ALGORITHMS (A1: TASK 1)

### 2.1	PROBLEM OVERVIEW

The company, Apple, is required to pay Samsung one billion dollars. The Samsung CEO has decided to take revenge on Apple and pay the amount owed in coins. Samsung has an unlimited number of coins however all the coins in Samsung’s vault are primes including 1 and the Gold coin (which is equivalent to the amount owed).
In this hypothetical situation, we are required to assume that we are the principal software engineer at Samsung. The CEO wants you to develop a program that can calculate the number of combinations in which a given amount can be paid using a specified number of coins.

### 2.2	INPUT SPECIFICATIONS

The input for the program must be given by a file named “input.txt”. Within the file, there may be up to 3 integer values in each line. For each of the lines, if one integer is given, this is the amount to be paid using all combinations of coins. If two integers are given, the first integer is the amount to be paid while the second integer is the number of coins that should be used to pay the amount. If three integers are given, the first integer is the amount to be paid while the second integer is the minimum number of coins that can be used, and the third integer is the maximum number of coins that can be used. 

### 2.3	OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS

The output of the program must be given in a file named “output.txt”. The file will contain the corresponding outputs for each line in “input.txt”. The output is the number of combinations in which the amount owed can be paid using the coins.
